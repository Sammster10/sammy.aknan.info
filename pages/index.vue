              It all began with Minecraft. The creativity that I was offered was unmatched - it trained my brain and
              helped
              me develop strong problem solving skills. Starting in 2018, I began experimenting with Minecraft's
              command
              system; it is comparable to block programming. Even though I was still only learning at the time, I
              quickly
              turned my limited skill set into a profitable side hustle.

              Up until this point, I was only playing Minecraft Bedrock Edition, and this was a huge limitation. I
              finally made the jump ot Minecraft Java Edition, and I was blown away by the amount of freedom I had. I
              initially stuck to my tendencies and began to develop Minecraft commands, but I quickly realized that
              there was a much better way to do things. I began to learn Java, and while it was difficult since I had no
              formal
              education on the topic, I was able to learn the basics and begin to develop Minecraft plugins.

              Moving on to bigger and better things, I gathered a team of staff members and we began to develop a
              Minecraft
              Realm network. We had ~40 concurrent players online at any given time, and things were looking good. At
              this
              time, I got my hands on my first computer and I began to dive into the game files. I learned about JSON
              for the first
              time, and while it was probably a simple config file - I finally learned how much potential there was in
              programming.

              With my knowledge of of Java, I created a Minecraft Java Edition server, and I surprised myself with what
              I was capable of! The server was a great success and I was learning super quickly. The server ran in the
              cloud and had multiple different aspects to it. I had a website, a Discord server, a Minecraft server, and
              a Web store. This forced me to learn about Databases in order to store all this data in one centralized
              location.
