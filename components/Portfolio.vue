          By far, my history with Minecraft servers has had an enormous impact on where I am today. Over the course of
          many years, I created many servers/realms (too many to count) which have seen tens of thousands of players
          connect and play on them. From using simple Minecraft commands,

          each one of these servers was better than the last.

        <p>
          Over the years, I've created a catalog of tutorial-style YouTube videos in which I would teach people a
          programming concept, or simply show them how to complete a task. As I continued learning and my skill set
          evolved, I tried to reflect that in my YouTube videos and teach my audience more complex topics. While I
          don't make as many YouTube videos anymore, all of my videos are still publicly viewable and

      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Web-development always seemed impossible to me - I suck at graphic design, but I loved the idea of creating
          interactive websites that thousands of people could use. I understood the potential that web-development had
          to offer, so I pushed myself to learn HTML & CSS as well as web-frameworks such as ReactJS and NuxtJS. As I
          mentioned earlier, graphic design is not my area of experience.
          This isn't necessarily a bad thing however, it forces me to work super

    <h2>Minecraft Marketplace Content</h2>

        <p>
          The Minecraft Marketplace is a service that both individuals and large organizations can apply for in order
          to sell Minecraft content (skins, worlds, textures, etc...) directly to customers via Minecraft's built in
          store. I've been part of a few small teams where I have collaborated with others to create fully interactive
          game-modes that were later published on the Minecraft Marketplace. For about half of these projects, I was
          the
          project lead; I came up with the various feature sets that would be implemented into the game as well as
          deciding what assets the project would need. Generally I worked on the more technical side of things - I'm a
          software developer after all so it only makes sense that
